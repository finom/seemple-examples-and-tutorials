# Seemple.js examples and tutorials

This repo contains examples and important tutorials for Seemple.js framework to keep all additional teaching materials (besides [the main documentation](https://seemple.js.org/)) at a single place.

I would recommend to start your journey from [Hello World](./hello-world), [Seemple.Object example](./seemple-object) and [Seemple.Array example](./seemple-array). Then read an article which explains one of the most important part of Seemple.js framework: [the events](./events).

### Other examples
- [Contact List](./contact-list)
- [Markdown Editor](./markdown-editor)
- [Treeview](./treeview)
- [Soundcloud Search](./soundcloud-search)
- [TodoMVC](./todomvc)

If you've noticed problems (e. g. live example doesn't work), feel free to report an issue or make pull-requests.
