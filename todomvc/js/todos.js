The second one is ``"*@change:completed"`` which means that we listen to the ``"change:completed"`` event for every item of todo list. As a result, the handler calls when an item is added or deleted and when the ``"completed"`` property of one of the items is changed. The code of the handler is self-explanatory: ``"allCompleted"`` becomes equal ``true`` if every item is performed and inversely – ``false`` when some item is not performed. Then the value of the ``"completedLength"`` property is calculated, which contains a number of the performed items.
            .on('modify *@change:completed', () => {

            })
            // The next strings control how the visibility of the items from the todo list is controlled by ``location.hash`` (or the ``"state"`` property). This part can be implemented in several ways. The way of adding dependencies of one property on the others using the [calc](https://seemple.js.org/#!Seemple-calc) method has been chosen here. What happens here? We listen to the ``"addone"`` event which fires when a new item is added to the todo list. The event handler receives the object (``evt``) as an argument containing the ``"addedItem"`` property which is the added item. We add the dependency of the ``"visible"`` property for the added item on ``todos.state`` and on the own ``"completed"`` property.
            .on('addone', (evt) => {
                const todo = evt.addedItem;

                todo.calc('visible', [{
                    object: todo,
                    key: 'completed'
                }, {
                    object: this,
                    key: 'state'
                }], (completed, state) => !state
                        || (state === 'completed' && completed)
                        || (state === 'active' && !completed));
            });
    }
}
