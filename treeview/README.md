# TreeView example

[Demo](http://matreshkajs.github.io/matreshka-examples-and-tutorials/treeview/)

This is the TreeView application written in Matreshka.js framework. The example stores full application state in ``localStorage`` (tree structure, labels, expanded or not). All your changes will be restored on every reload.
